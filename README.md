# 1Ô∏è‚É£ One-liner Python Programs

This repository is dedicated to exploring the capabilities of the Python programming language by attempting to write one-liner programs, where each program is composed of a single logical line of code, to solve various problem statements. These one-liners are meant for educational and entertainment purposes, allowing you to see what's possible in Python.

**‚ö†Ô∏èDISCLAIMER‚ö†Ô∏è**: The one-liner programs showcased in this repository are not intended for production use or as best coding practices. They are primarily for experimentation and learning. Avoid using one-liners in real-world projects, as they can make your code less readable and maintainable.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, feel free to submit your one-liner Python programs! Follow these guidelines to make the process smooth:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Add your one-liner program to the relevant category or create a new category if needed.
4. Ensure that your code is well-documented and readable, despite being a of one logical line (one-liner).
5. Submit a pull request.

## üóÇÔ∏è Categories

You can find one-liner Python programs organized into different categories, such as:
- Mathematical operations
- String manipulation
- Data structures
- File handling
- And more!
